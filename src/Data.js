I started my educational journey in a government school in my village and later pursued my studies in electrical associate engineering from a technical college (located in kamra city) from 2016 to 2019. Afterward, I ventured into the world of computer science and obtained my degree from 2019 to 2023 from Arid university. These days, I'm deeply involved in the fields of React, Django, and Machine Learning. I find immense joy in exploring the realm of IoT, where I've undertaken various projects. The combination of electronics and IoT has always fascinated me, and I thoroughly enjoy experimenting with electronic components."
